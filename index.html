			 <p>
				I am a "roamer" and a "learner".  My love for learning and exploring took me to more than 35 countries, worked as an expat in Asia and lived in many cities across the U.S.  Fortunately, my husband and daughter also share the same passion so vacation destination selection is always a long annual process.  Lots of research, debate, and negotiation are all in play during this period.

				On the professional side I am an experienced business leader who is in the process of adding new tech skills to her toolbox.  I have worked in many industries ranging from power generation, aviation, banking, financial services, insurance to healthcare.  To see more details on my profile, click on Linkedin above.
